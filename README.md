## How to test application:

```mvn test```

## How to build a docker image

For building a dockerfile, firstly you must package the project into an executable jar file. If you executed the tests in a previous step, you can skip tests execution:

```mvn package -DskipTests=true```

Then, you'll have a executable jar file in ```target``` folder.

Then, you can run your docker build command. You must run it on root folde:

```docker build -t <app-name> .```

Then you can run your docker image:

```docker run -p 8080:8080 <app-name>```

Or deploy in a K8 environment. The application port is 8080

You can verify your app is up in the url [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html]()
